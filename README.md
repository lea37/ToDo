# ToDo

Yes i know there is plenty of to do list app and exercises everywhere. BUT ! I wanted to do it without any framework to understand the full js logic. 

There is commentary to understand the logic between modules and i hope that variables and methods namings are pertinent too.
You can also check if your data are correctly injected by logging the `dataController.testing()` method.

Thanks to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) full js courses that teached me a lot.
